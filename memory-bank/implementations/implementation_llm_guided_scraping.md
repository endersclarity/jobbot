# Implementation Plan: LLM-Guided Scraping Architecture

## Overview
This implementation plan details the transition from automated scraping to LLM-guided data extraction, establishing a new paradigm where Claude Code and Browser MCP work together with human guidance to extract job data reliably and adaptively.

## Strategic Context
After extensive attempts with automated scraping (Crawlee, Puppeteer, anti-detection), we discovered that modern anti-bot measures make fully automated scraping unreliable and complex. The LLM-guided approach leverages human+AI collaboration to achieve superior results with lower complexity and maintenance burden.

2. **LLM Navigation Patterns**
   - Design repeatable patterns for LLM-guided site navigation
   - Create templates for common interactions (search, login, pagination)
   - Establish LLM prompting strategies for site interpretation
   - Test adaptive navigation on various job site structures

3. **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**
   - Design authentication workflow with human intervention
   - Create clear handoff patterns between LLM automation and human assistance
