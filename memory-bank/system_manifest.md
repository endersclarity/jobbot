## System Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async support and auto-documentation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development/testing)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with Alembic migrations
- **Task Queue**: Celery + Redis for background processing
- **Testing**: pytest with async support and coverage reporting
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger

### Database Schema (Implemented)
```sql
-- Core job management
jobs (id, title, company, location, salary_range, description, requirements, 
      benefits, job_url, source_site, scraped_date, posting_date, 
      application_deadline, remote_option, job_type, experience_level, 
      industry, keywords, status)

-- Application tracking  
applications (id, job_id, application_date, status, cover_letter_version,
              resume_version, interview_date, response_date, notes,
              credibility_rating, exaggeration_level, integrity_score)

-- Response monitoring
employer_responses (id, application_id, response_date, response_type,
                   subject_line, email_content, sentiment_score, 
                   requires_action, action_taken, follow_up_scheduled)

-- Reference management
references (id, name, title, company, email, phone, relationship,
           consent_given, consent_date, last_contacted, usage_count,
           credibility_score, notes)

-- Experience validation
experience_claims (id, application_id, claim_type, original_experience,
                  claimed_experience, exaggeration_multiplier, 
                  credibility_impact, justification)
```

### MCP Server Integration
- **postgres**: Database operations and complex queries
- **filesystem**: File management and scraped data storage
- **fetch**: HTTP requests and API integrations
- **puppeteer**: Advanced web scraping and automation
- **gmail**: Email automation and response monitoring
- **browsermcp**: Real browser automation (anti-detection)

## Development Phases (Implemented)

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation & Database Setup (COMPLETE)
- Project structure with proper Python packaging
- FastAPI application with CORS and health checks
- PostgreSQL database models with comprehensive schema
- Alembic migration system configured
- Environment configuration with secure defaults
- Testing framework with pytest and fixtures
- Development tooling (Makefile, linting, formatting)

### âœ… Phase 2: Core API & Basic Job Management (COMPLETE)
- Complete REST API for jobs, applications, responses
- Auto-generated API documentation at `/docs`
- Input validation and error handling
- Filtering and search capabilities
- CRUD operations for all core entities
- API running on WSL IP 172.22.206.209:8000

### ðŸš§ Phase 3: Strategic Pivot & Raw Data Collection (IN PROGRESS)
**3A: Token-Efficient Scraping**
- Raw data collection without LLM processing
- Anti-detection measures with BrowserMCP
- Rate limiting and proxy rotation
- Structured data storage in `scraped_data/`

**3B: Business Intelligence Pipeline**
- Local company research automation  
- Market opportunity detection
- Value proposition generation
- Automated outreach system
