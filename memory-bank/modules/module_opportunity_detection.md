# Module: Opportunity Detection

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Opportunity Detection module analyzes processed company intelligence to identify specific automation opportunities, business pain points, and potential value propositions. This module serves as the strategic brain of the Business Intelligence Engine, transforming raw business data into scored, actionable opportunities for proactive client acquisition and solution development.

## Interfaces
* `OpportunityScanner`: Core opportunity identification
  * `scan_automation_potential()`: Identify processes suitable for automation
  * `detect_pain_points()`: Extract business challenges from job descriptions and company data
  * `calculate_impact_score()`: Estimate potential value and urgency of opportunities
  * `prioritize_targets()`: Rank companies by opportunity quality and accessibility
* `BusinessAnalyzer`: Strategic assessment
  * `analyze_growth_signals()`: Detect hiring patterns indicating business expansion
  * `assess_technology_gaps()`: Identify outdated systems and inefficiencies
  * `evaluate_competition()`: Analyze competitive landscape and positioning
* `ROICalculator`: Value estimation
  * `estimate_cost_savings()`: Calculate potential automation savings
  * `project_efficiency_gains()`: Model productivity improvements
  * `assess_implementation_effort()`: Estimate solution complexity and timeline
* Input: Processed company data, job market intelligence, technology trends
* Output: Scored opportunity lists, business case templates, target company profiles
