# Module: Dashboard Interface

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Dashboard Interface module provides real-time visualization and control of the entire Business Intelligence Engine through a modern, responsive web interface. This module serves as the command center for monitoring data collection, analyzing opportunities, tracking outreach campaigns, and managing the overall business development process with comprehensive analytics and actionable insights.

## Interfaces
* `DashboardAPI`: Backend data services
  * `get_metrics()`: Retrieve real-time performance data
  * `get_opportunities()`: Fetch scored business opportunities
  * `get_campaigns()`: Access outreach campaign data
  * `export_reports()`: Generate business intelligence reports
* `RealTimeUpdates`: Live data streaming
  * `stream_scraping_status()`: WebSocket updates for data collection progress
  * `stream_opportunity_alerts()`: Real-time notifications for high-value opportunities
  * `stream_campaign_metrics()`: Live outreach performance tracking
* `VisualizationEngine`: Chart and graph generation
  * `render_trend_charts()`: Display market and technology trends
  * `create_conversion_funnels()`: Visualize campaign performance
  * `generate_heatmaps()`: Show geographic and industry opportunity distribution
* Input: Aggregated data from all modules, user interaction events
* Output: Interactive web interface, real-time visualizations, business reports
