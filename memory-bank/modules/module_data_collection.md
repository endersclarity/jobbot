# Module: Data Collection

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Data Collection module serves as the foundation for the Business Intelligence Engine, responsible for gathering raw job posting data from multiple sources through sophisticated web scraping techniques. This module implements anti-detection measures, rate limiting, and data quality validation to ensure reliable, high-volume data acquisition while maintaining compliance with website terms of service.

## Interfaces
* `JobScraper`: Primary scraping interface
  * `scrape_indeed()`: Extract job listings from Indeed.com
  * `scrape_linkedin()`: Extract job listings from LinkedIn
  * `scrape_glassdoor()`: Extract job listings from Glassdoor
  * `validate_data()`: Verify scraped data quality and completeness
* `BrowserManager`: Anti-detection browser management
  * `create_session()`: Initialize browser with anti-detection features
  * `rotate_user_agent()`: Randomize browser fingerprints
  * `manage_proxies()`: Handle proxy rotation for IP diversification
* Input: Search parameters (location, keywords, job types)
* Output: Raw HTML, JSON data files stored in `scraped_data/raw/`

## Implementation Details
* Files: 
  - `app/scrapers/indeed.py` - Indeed-specific scraping logic with anti-detection
  - `app/scrapers/browser_scraper.py` - Core browser automation and session management
  - `app/scrapers/business_discovery.py` - Company research and discovery methods
  - `src/crawlee-scraper.js` - Crawlee-based Node.js scraping infrastructure
  - `src/scrapers/` - Site-specific JavaScript scrapers (indeed, linkedin, glassdoor)
* Important algorithms: 
  - Circuit breaker pattern for handling failed requests
  - Exponential backoff for rate limiting compliance
  - Content fingerprinting for duplicate detection
  - Dynamic selector adaptation for UI changes
* Data Models
  - `RawJobData`: Unprocessed scraped content with metadata
  - `ScrapingSession`: Session tracking with performance metrics
  - `SiteConfiguration`: Site-specific scraping parameters and constraints

## Current Implementation Status
* Completed: 
  - Indeed scraper with BrowserMCP anti-detection (bypasses 403 errors)
  - Basic browser automation with Selenium fallback
  - Rate limiting and request throttling
  - Raw data storage infrastructure in `scraped_data/raw/`
  - Multi-site orchestration with Node.js Crawlee framework
* In Progress: 
  - LinkedIn and Glassdoor scraper optimization
  - Enhanced proxy rotation and fingerprint management
  - Automated scraping schedule and monitoring
* Pending: 
  - Company website direct analysis
  - Social media presence scraping
  - Real-time data streaming for high-priority targets
