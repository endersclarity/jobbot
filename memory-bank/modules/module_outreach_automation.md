  * `optimize_messaging()`: A/B test and refine communication effectiveness
* `MessageGenerator`: Content creation
  * `personalize_outreach()`: Create company-specific messaging
  * `attach_demos()`: Include relevant proof-of-concept solutions
  * `craft_follow_ups()`: Generate contextual follow-up sequences
* `ResponseTracker`: Engagement monitoring
  * `parse_responses()`: Analyze reply content and sentiment
  * `update_lead_status()`: Track progression through sales pipeline
  * `trigger_follow_ups()`: Automate next steps based on response patterns
* Input: Company profiles, generated solutions, contact information
* Output: Sent communications, response analytics, lead qualification data
