# Module: Database Infrastructure

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Database Infrastructure module provides the foundational data storage, retrieval, and management capabilities for the entire Business Intelligence Engine. This module ensures data integrity, performance, and scalability while supporting complex business intelligence queries, real-time analytics, and secure multi-user access to enterprise-scale datasets.

## Interfaces
* `DatabaseManager`: Core data operations
  * `execute_query()`: Perform optimized database queries
  * `manage_connections()`: Handle connection pooling and performance
  * `backup_data()`: Automated backup and disaster recovery
  * `monitor_performance()`: Track query performance and optimization
* `SchemaManager`: Database structure management
  * `apply_migrations()`: Manage database schema evolution
  * `create_indexes()`: Optimize query performance
  * `validate_constraints()`: Ensure data integrity
* `AnalyticsEngine`: Business intelligence queries
  * `aggregate_metrics()`: Generate business intelligence summaries
  * `trend_analysis()`: Perform time-series analysis on business data
  * `generate_reports()`: Create complex analytical reports
* Input: Application data from all modules, migration scripts, configuration
* Output: Structured data storage, query results, performance metrics, backups

## Implementation Details
* Files:
  - `app/core/database.py` - Database connection and session management
  - `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy data models for all business entities
  - `alembic/` - Database migration scripts and version control
  - `scripts/backup-db.sh` - Automated backup and recovery scripts
* Important algorithms:
  - Connection pooling for high-performance concurrent access
  - Query optimization and index management
  - Data partitioning for large-scale analytics
  - Automated backup and point-in-time recovery
* Data Models
  - `Job`: Core job posting data with full metadata
  - `Company`: Business intelligence and company profiles
  - `Opportunity`: Identified automation opportunities with scoring
  - `OutreachCampaign`: Marketing campaign tracking and analytics
  - `ScrapingSession`: Data collection performance and monitoring

## Current Implementation Status
* Completed:
  - PostgreSQL database with comprehensive schema design
  - SQLAlchemy ORM with relationship mapping
  - Alembic migration system for schema versioning
  - Connection pooling and performance optimization
  - Basic backup and recovery procedures
* In Progress:
  - Business intelligence optimizations and indexing
  - Advanced analytics query optimization
  - Real-time data streaming and caching
  - Automated monitoring and alerting systems
* Pending:
  - Multi-tenant architecture for client data isolation
  - Advanced security and access control systems
  - Data warehouse integration for historical analytics
  - Automated scaling and load balancing
