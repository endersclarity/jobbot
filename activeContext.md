  - ‚úÖ All core dependencies resolved and functional

## Architecture Components (Planned)
1. **Web Scraper Module**: Job board data extraction
2. **Resume Engine**: Dynamic resume generation based on job requirements
3. **Cover Letter Generator**: Personalized cover letter creation
4. **Email Automation**: Application submission and follow-up
5. **Database System**: Application tracking and analytics
6. **Response Monitor**: Email parsing and status updates
7. **Dashboard**: Progress monitoring and manual overrides

## Success Metrics
- **Applications per day**: Target 10-20 automated applications
- **Response rate**: Track and optimize based on resume/letter variations
- **Time saved**: Eliminate manual application process
- **Follow-up compliance**: 100% follow-up rate within defined timeframes

## Key Decisions Made
- Using persistent memory system for project context
- Focusing on automation over manual intervention
- Building modular architecture for easy maintenance

## NEW ARCHITECTURE DECISION: Token-Efficient Scraping Strategy

### Phase 3A: Raw Data Collection (No LLM Processing)
- **Goal**: Scrape job sites and save raw data files locally
- **Strategy**: Avoid processing scraped content through Claude Code to prevent token burn
- **Output**: Raw JSON/HTML files saved to `scraped_data/` directory
- **Benefits**: Can scrape thousands of jobs without Claude Code token limits

### Phase 3B: Offline Processing Pipeline  
- **Goal**: Clean and structure raw data outside Claude Code
- **Strategy**: Simple parsing, deduplication, data validation
- **Output**: Clean JSON files ready for database import
- **LLM Processing**: Done separately by user for resume/cover letter optimization

## Phase 3 Comprehensive Todo List

### Phase 3A: Raw Data Collection (High Priority)
1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - ‚úÖ Set up Phase 3A: Raw Data Collection infrastructure
   - ‚úÖ Create scraped_data/ directory structure with date-based organization
   - ‚úÖ Design scraper configuration system for search terms, locations, limits

2. **Core Scraping Engine**
   - ‚úÖ Implement core Indeed scraper with requests/BeautifulSoup
   - ‚úÖ Add intelligent rate limiting and request delays to avoid detection
   - ‚úÖ Build robust error handling with retry logic and failure logging
   - ‚úÖ Create raw data storage system (JSON files with metadata)

3. **Advanced Scraping Features**
   - ‚úÖ Implement user agent rotation and request header randomization
   - ‚è≥ Add proxy rotation support for large-scale scraping
   - ‚è≥ Add progress tracking and resume capability for interrupted scraping
   - ‚úÖ Build CLI interface for running scrapers with parameters

### Phase 3B: Offline Processing Pipeline (Medium Priority)
4. **Processing Infrastructure** 
   - ‚è≥ Set up Phase 3B: Offline Processing Pipeline infrastructure
   - ‚è≥ Build HTML parser to extract job details from scraped pages
   - ‚è≥ Create data normalization pipeline for consistent job records
   - ‚è≥ Implement duplicate job detection and deduplication logic

5. **Data Enhancement**
   - ‚è≥ Create salary range parsing and normalization
   - ‚è≥ Design batch processing system for offline data pipeline
   - ‚è≥ Integrate processed data with existing JobBot database
   - ‚è≥ Implement data quality validation and filtering rules

### Phase 3C: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
6. **Smart Processing**
   - ‚è≥ Build skill extraction from job descriptions using NLP
   - ‚è≥ Implement location standardization and geocoding
   - ‚è≥ Create monitoring dashboard for scraping and processing metrics
   - ‚è≥ Build automated scheduling system for regular scraping runs

7. **Development & Operations**
   - ‚è≥ Create comprehensive testing suite for scraping and processing
   - ‚è≥ Write comprehensive documentation for scraping system

## Immediate Next Steps

2. **‚úÖ PR #1 Merged** - Phase 2 code in production
3. **‚úÖ Phase 3A Infrastructure** - Raw data collection system built
4. **‚úÖ Scraper Core Complete** - Indeed scraper with rate limiting and CLI
5. **‚úÖ BrowserMCP Validation** - Successfully tested Indeed job scraping, bypassed 403 errors
6. **‚úÖ Strategic Reframe Complete** - Comprehensive market creation strategy documented
7. **‚úÖ HDTA Architecture Complete** - Generated complete memory-bank/ structure with:
   - system_manifest.md (comprehensive project overview)
   - module documentation (API, Scrapers, Database)
   - implementation plans (Strategic Pivot, Phase 3B)
   - project roadmap (strategic evolution timeline)
8. **üöß NEXT: Commit HDTA Architecture** - Git commit the complete memory-bank/ structure
9. **üöß NEXT: Implement Phase 3B** - Build offline processing pipeline for raw data
10. **üöß NEXT: Strategic Pivot Implementation** - Begin BusinessBot transformation
