## Architecture Components (Planned)
1. **Web Scraper Module**: Job board data extraction
2. **Resume Engine**: Dynamic resume generation based on job requirements
3. **Cover Letter Generator**: Personalized cover letter creation
4. **Email Automation**: Application submission and follow-up
5. **Database System**: Application tracking and analytics
6. **Response Monitor**: Email parsing and status updates
7. **Dashboard**: Progress monitoring and manual overrides

## Success Metrics
- **Applications per day**: Target 10-20 automated applications
- **Response rate**: Track and optimize based on resume/letter variations
- **Time saved**: Eliminate manual application process
- **Follow-up compliance**: 100% follow-up rate within defined timeframes

## Key Decisions Made
- Using persistent memory system for project context
- Focusing on automation over manual intervention
- Building modular architecture for easy maintenance

## NEW ARCHITECTURE DECISION: Token-Efficient Scraping Strategy

### Phase 3A: Raw Data Collection (No LLM Processing)
- **Goal**: Scrape job sites and save raw data files locally
- **Strategy**: Avoid processing scraped content through Claude Code to prevent token burn
- **Output**: Raw JSON/HTML files saved to `scraped_data/` directory
- **Benefits**: Can scrape thousands of jobs without Claude Code token limits

### Phase 3B: Offline Processing Pipeline  
- **Goal**: Clean and structure raw data outside Claude Code
- **Strategy**: Simple parsing, deduplication, data validation
- **Output**: Clean JSON files ready for database import
- **LLM Processing**: Done separately by user for resume/cover letter optimization

## Phase 3 Comprehensive Todo List

### Phase 3A: Raw Data Collection (High Priority)
1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - ‚úÖ Set up Phase 3A: Raw Data Collection infrastructure
   - ‚úÖ Create scraped_data/ directory structure with date-based organization

   - ‚úÖ Create raw data storage system (JSON files with metadata)

3. **Advanced Scraping Features**
   - ‚úÖ Implement user agent rotation and request header randomization
   - ‚è≥ Add proxy rotation support for large-scale scraping
   - ‚è≥ Add progress tracking and resume capability for interrupted scraping

   - ‚è≥ Create data normalization pipeline for consistent job records
   - ‚è≥ Implement duplicate job detection and deduplication logic

5. **Data Enhancement**
   - ‚è≥ Create salary range parsing and normalization
   - ‚è≥ Design batch processing system for offline data pipeline
   - ‚è≥ Integrate processed data with existing JobBot database
   - ‚è≥ Implement data quality validation and filtering rules

### Phase 3C: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
6. **Smart Processing**
   - ‚è≥ Build skill extraction from job descriptions using NLP
   - ‚è≥ Implement location standardization and geocoding
   - ‚è≥ Create monitoring dashboard for scraping and processing metrics
   - ‚è≥ Build automated scheduling system for regular scraping runs

7. **Development & Operations**
