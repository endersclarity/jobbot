# Active Context - Job Search Automation

**Project**: Job Search Automation System  
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-24 18:33:00  
**Status**: Initial Setup & Planning  
**Priority**: High  

## Current Goals
1. **Primary**: Build fully automated job search and application system
2. **Secondary**: Create comprehensive tracking and follow-up automation
3. **Tertiary**: Develop resume/cover letter customization engine

## Project Vision
Automated end-to-end job search pipeline that:
- Scrapes job boards for relevant positions
- Generates tailored resumes and cover letters
- Submits applications automatically
- Tracks application status and responses
- Manages follow-up communications
- Maintains detailed application database

## Current State
- **Phase**: Project scaffolding and architecture planning
- **Next Action**: Complete project setup with all required context files
- **Blockers**: None
- **Decisions Needed**: Technology stack selection, target job boards

## Architecture Components (Planned)
1. **Web Scraper Module**: Job board data extraction
2. **Resume Engine**: Dynamic resume generation based on job requirements
3. **Cover Letter Generator**: Personalized cover letter creation
4. **Email Automation**: Application submission and follow-up
5. **Database System**: Application tracking and analytics
6. **Response Monitor**: Email parsing and status updates
7. **Dashboard**: Progress monitoring and manual overrides

## Success Metrics
- **Applications per day**: Target 10-20 automated applications
- **Response rate**: Track and optimize based on resume/letter variations
- **Time saved**: Eliminate manual application process
- **Follow-up compliance**: 100% follow-up rate within defined timeframes

## Key Decisions Made
- Using persistent memory system for project context
- Focusing on automation over manual intervention
- Building modular architecture for easy maintenance

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete project scaffolding with all required files
2. Define technology stack (Python, APIs, databases)
3. Research target job boards and scraping requirements
4. Design database schema for application tracking
