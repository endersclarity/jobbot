# Active Context - Job Search Automation

**Project**: Job Search Automation System  
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-24 22:30:00  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Phase 2 In Progress  
**Priority**: High  

## Current Goals
1. **Primary**: Build fully automated job search and application system
2. **Secondary**: Create comprehensive tracking and follow-up automation
3. **Tertiary**: Develop resume/cover letter customization engine

## Project Vision
Automated end-to-end job search pipeline that:
- Scrapes job boards for relevant positions
- Generates tailored resumes and cover letters
- Submits applications automatically
- Tracks application status and responses
- Manages follow-up communications
- Maintains detailed application database

## Current State
- **Phase**: âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE, ðŸš§ PHASE 2 IN PROGRESS - Core API & CRUD Operations
- **Current Branch**: `feature/phase-2-api` 
- **Next Action**: Complete Phase 2, then implement token-efficient Phase 3 scraping
- **Recent Work**: Server running successfully, CRUD operations functional, API docs accessible
- **Server Status**: JobBot running on WSL IP 172.22.206.209:8000 âœ… Browser accessible
- **API Status**: Interactive docs at http://172.22.206.209:8000/docs âœ… Working
- **Blockers**: None - ready for Phase 2 completion and Phase 3 planning
- **Decisions Made**: 
  - Technology stack: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React
  - MCP servers installed: postgres, filesystem, fetch, puppeteer, gmail
  - 9-phase incremental development plan created
  - Testing framework: pytest with async support and coverage
  - Development workflow: Makefile with standardized commands
  - **NEW**: codeRABBIT review process for all pull requests
  - **NEW**: Project-specific CLAUDE.md with quality standards
  - **FIXED**: Pydantic v2 compatibility issues resolved
  - **FIXED**: SQLAlchemy relationship naming conflicts (relationship â†’ relationship_type)
  - **SWITCHED**: PostgreSQL â†’ SQLite for immediate demo functionality
- **Current Capabilities**: 
  - âœ… Complete Python project structure with proper packaging
  - âœ… Production-ready FastAPI application with health checks
  - âœ… Comprehensive database models with relationships and constraints
  - âœ… Alembic migration system configured and ready
  - âœ… Testing framework with database isolation and coverage
  - âœ… Development tools (linting, formatting, testing) integrated
  - âœ… Secure configuration system with environment variables
  - âœ… Basic API endpoints with CORS and documentation
  - âœ… GitHub repository: https://github.com/endersclarity/jobbot
  - âœ… SQLite database with working CRUD operations
  - âœ… Server running successfully on WSL (172.22.206.209:8000)
  - âœ… All core dependencies resolved and functional

## Architecture Components (Planned)
1. **Web Scraper Module**: Job board data extraction
2. **Resume Engine**: Dynamic resume generation based on job requirements
3. **Cover Letter Generator**: Personalized cover letter creation
4. **Email Automation**: Application submission and follow-up
5. **Database System**: Application tracking and analytics
6. **Response Monitor**: Email parsing and status updates
7. **Dashboard**: Progress monitoring and manual overrides

## Success Metrics
- **Applications per day**: Target 10-20 automated applications
- **Response rate**: Track and optimize based on resume/letter variations
- **Time saved**: Eliminate manual application process
- **Follow-up compliance**: 100% follow-up rate within defined timeframes

## Key Decisions Made
- Using persistent memory system for project context
- Focusing on automation over manual intervention
- Building modular architecture for easy maintenance

## NEW ARCHITECTURE DECISION: Token-Efficient Scraping Strategy

### Phase 3A: Raw Data Collection (No LLM Processing)
- **Goal**: Scrape job sites and save raw data files locally
- **Strategy**: Avoid processing scraped content through Claude Code to prevent token burn
- **Output**: Raw JSON/HTML files saved to `scraped_data/` directory
- **Benefits**: Can scrape thousands of jobs without Claude Code token limits

### Phase 3B: Offline Processing Pipeline  
- **Goal**: Clean and structure raw data outside Claude Code
- **Strategy**: Simple parsing, deduplication, data validation
- **Output**: Clean JSON files ready for database import
- **LLM Processing**: Done separately by user for resume/cover letter optimization

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Phase 2** - finalize CRUD operations and API endpoints
2. **Commit and create PR** for Phase 2 completion 
3. **Design Phase 3A scraper** - raw data collection architecture
4. **Build token-efficient scrapers** for Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor
5. **Create offline processing pipeline** for data cleaning and import
