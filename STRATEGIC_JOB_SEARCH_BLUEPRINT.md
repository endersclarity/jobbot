# Strategic Job Search Blueprint

**Branch**: `feature/phase-3-job-site-analysis`  
**Purpose**: ⚡ **MARKET CREATION STRATEGY** - Position as AI automation expert, don't just job search  
**Focus**: **Value-first market making** - Create demand rather than respond to it  
**Date**: 2025-05-24  

---

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL STRATEGIC REFRAME** ⚠️

**❌ STOP:** Traditional job applications (you're fighting an unwinnable game)  
**✅ START:** Market category creation (become the AI automation expert businesses don't know they need)

### The Brutal Truth
- **Traditional hiring = optimized to exclude you** (no degree, no "experience")
- **Your actual value = invisible to HR gatekeepers** (they can't evaluate AI automation skills)
- **CS grads = operating on outdated knowledge** while you're building cutting-edge solutions
- **The system is broken** - not you

### The New Strategy: **Don't Get Hired, Get Sought After**
