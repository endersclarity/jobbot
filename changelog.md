### Decisions Made
- Technology stack: Planning Python-based solution
- Architecture: Modular design with 7 core components
- Target: 10-20 automated applications per day
- Focus: Full automation over manual intervention

### Next Steps
- Create Phase 1 feature branch
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Install core dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL)
- Begin database schema implementation

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-24

### Added
- **Development Roadmap**: Created comprehensive 9-phase incremental development plan
- **MCP Server Integration**: Installed essential MCP servers for JobBot functionality:
  - postgres: Database operations
  - filesystem: File management
  - fetch: HTTP requests for APIs
  - puppeteer: Web scraping automation
  - gmail: Email automation
- **Branch Strategy**: Defined feature branch workflow for each development phase
- **Testing Strategy**: Established testing criteria and success metrics per phase

### Technical Decisions
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Scraping**: Puppeteer + BeautifulSoup hybrid approach
- **Email**: Gmail integration via MCP server

### Project Status

## [1.0.0] - 2025-05-24

### ðŸŽ‰ PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Foundation & Database Setup

### Added - Core Infrastructure
- **Project Structure**: Complete Python package structure with app/, core/, models/, api/, services/, scrapers/, tests/
- **FastAPI Application**: Production-ready API with CORS, health checks, and auto-documentation
- **Database Models**: Comprehensive SQLAlchemy models for all tables:
  - Jobs: Job postings with metadata and scraping info
  - Applications: Application tracking with integrity monitoring  
  - EmployerResponses: Response parsing and sentiment analysis
  - References: Reference management with usage tracking
  - ExperienceClaims: Credibility monitoring system
- **Configuration System**: Secure Pydantic settings with environment variables
- **Migration System**: Alembic configuration for database schema management
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with async support, test database isolation, coverage reporting

### Added - Development Tools

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
- **Git Configuration**: Proper .gitignore with security exclusions

### Added - API Endpoints
- Health check with database connectivity test
- API v1 root with endpoint discovery
- Basic job management routes (GET /jobs, GET /jobs/{id})
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

### Added - Testing Infrastructure  
- Test client with database override
- Model validation tests
- API endpoint tests
- Relationship testing between models
- Coverage reporting with HTML output

### Technical Achievements
- âœ… Database connection and CRUD operations functional
- âœ… All models load without errors
- âœ… FastAPI application starts successfully  
- âœ… Test suite passes with full coverage
- âœ… Migration system configured and ready
- âœ… Development workflow established

### Next Steps
