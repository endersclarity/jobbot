- LinkedIn: 114,000+ (limited detail without auth)
- Glassdoor: 43,698 (full detail, fully scrapable)
- Dice: 8,460 (tech-focused)

### **Indeed's Potential: ~200,000**
- **Cost**: $50-70/month for residential proxies
- **Additional Jobs**: ~33,842 more than current accessible total
- **Cost per Additional Job**: $1.47 - $2.07 per month per extra job

## üéØ **REALITY CHECK CONCLUSION**

### **Is Indeed Worth The Proxy Costs?**

**FUCK NO.** Here's why:

1. **We already have 166K+ jobs accessible for FREE**
2. **Glassdoor's 43K jobs are FULLY scrapable right now**
3. **LinkedIn's 114K jobs show huge potential (just need to handle auth)**
4. **Indeed would cost $600-840/year for ~20% more jobs**

### **The Smart Strategy:**

1. **Perfect Glassdoor scraping** (43K guaranteed jobs)
2. **Tackle LinkedIn authentication** (114K potential jobs)
3. **Test Dice.com scraping** (8K tech-focused jobs)
4. **Add API integrations** for additional sources

### **Math That Actually Matters:**
- **Current accessible**: 166K+ jobs
- **Cost**: $0
- **ROI**: ‚àû

- **With Indeed**: ~200K jobs  
- **Cost**: $600+/year
- **ROI**: Terrible

## üî• **THE VERDICT**

**Indeed is NOT fucking worth it.** We have access to 83% of Indeed's volume for FREE through other sites. The 17% additional jobs from Indeed would cost $50+/month.

**Better approach**: Perfect our FREE sources first, then consider Indeed only if we exhaust all other options.

*TL;DR: Indeed has more jobs but not THAT many more. We can get 166K+ jobs without proxies vs ~200K with expensive proxies. Do the math.*
